This is a component library for the `mlibre-point-map` component. This component allows you to add a series of points to a map. The component was built with [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/). There are no plans to include additional components.

## Basic usage

The component has default values which means the component should work out of the box without any additional configuration. 

```html
<mlibre-point-map></mlibre-point-map>
```

But, you can also modify these default values:

<Canvas 
  additionalActions={[
    {
      title: 'Open in GitHub',
      onClick: () => {
        window.open(
          'https://github.com/omarkawach/foss-gis-web-components',
          '_blank'
        );
      },
    }
  ]}
of={ComponentStory.Simple} 
/>
<Controls of={ComponentStory.Simple} />
